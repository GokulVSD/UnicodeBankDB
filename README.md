<h5 align="center">A file based digital banking system</h5>
<h6 align="center">Written during our 6th semester BE for a course specified mini project in File Structures (FS).</h6>

## 

<p align="center">
The system follows a 3-tier architecture, with a web based front end, Java + Spark as the HTTP server and router, and a pure file based database library built from scratch. JavaScript is used to build AJAX requests from the front end, which are served by a Java server running Spark as the application framework, which then proceeds to use the interface provided by the library. Maven was utilised as the build tool.
